# Description of the project
“The Bassics” is a musical toy designed to encourage the development of musical skills in a younger audience. The goal of the toy is to begin in a basic environment allowing the user to familiarize themselves with the layout of a bass guitar. With this, users can learn their first song through tabs sheets and apply them in this application.

# Instructions for use
Players are to tap circles on the fretboard to make the associated sound.

# How it works
When the player clicks a circle, a button is activated which sends a signal to the play function.

This is code:

```Java
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```

So is this without specifying the language:

```
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```
