# Description of the project
“The Bassics” is a musical toy designed to encourage the development of musical skills in a younger audience. The goal of the toy is to begin in a basic environment allowing the user to familiarize themselves with the layout of a bass guitar. With this, users can learn their first song through tabs sheets and apply them in this application.

# Instructions for use
Players are to tap circles on the fretboard to make the associated sound.

# How it works
When the player clicks a circle, a button is activated which sends a signal to the play function.

# What I am most proud of in the assignment
This assignment has taught me to use Godot effectively. Before I was not a lover of the software but have found great enjoyment in it. I am most proud of my UI.

#Timeline

1. 	Decide on an instrument.
2.	Designed a background which will fit the chosen aesthetic (synthwave core).
3.	Designed a fretboard UI matching background art.
4.	Used my bass to record.
5.	Edited audio in Audacity.
6.	Create button and streamplayer nodes.
7.	Insert buttons to scene.
8.	Create signals between buttons and streamplayer nodes.
9.	Mixed audio accordingly.
10.	Test run.
11.	Adjusted audio settings.
